# xmlprocessor

The goal of xmlprocessor is to help with the preparation of xml files. It was motivated by the laborious work of xml files processing that are used for simulations in an agronomic model (STICS). It strongly rests on the {xml2} package but contains functions that are wrappers for the creation and the filling of xml template.
